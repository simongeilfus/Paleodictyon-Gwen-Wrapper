#Paleodictyon Gwen Wrapper

__*Might not build, work or be useful/interesting at all! I'm just using github to archive the project. You better check Richard Eakin wrapper here:*__

##This is an archive! 


Archive of Paleodyction Gwen wrapper for cinder. The code was written in a rush and is tied to the main app and libs I wrote for this project. Those libs were not used after, this is the reason I never tried to maintain this wrapper.
After doing a few new projects with similar user interface, I realized that I will probably never implement anything like I did for Paleodyction. Time to move on!
